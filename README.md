# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project:
In this project, we edited and refactored a Microsoft Excel VBA code to analyze the performances of 12 sets of stocks for both year 2017 and 2018. The goal is to loop through all the data at one time and achieve the results in a more efficient way. The refactored code uses less memory and make it easier for future users to read.
